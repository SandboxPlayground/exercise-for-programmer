# exercise-for-programmer
Got inspired by a book Exercise for programmer

From a book [Excercise for programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers) I just want to have some thing not easy but very common to implement in many different language.

## How about
* I/O and processing
* Validate input
* Create a simple calculator
* Work with files
* Todo list

## Contraints
Do not use any language you know or very expert at but rather pick something new and noteworthy to try, or even use SQL to implement it.
